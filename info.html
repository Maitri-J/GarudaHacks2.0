        <h1>How should I recycle?</h1>
        <p>
            Different waste requires different recycling approach. This
            means that to recycle your waste, you need to sort them into
            different categories. However, you should also check your local
            recycling center and find out what they require regarding waste
            sorting. Here are two common methods of recycling.
        </p>
        <h3>Single Stream Recycling</h3>
        <p>
            This means collecting all recyclables with a single bin. The
            concept here is to make recycling easier for the general
            population by taking away the sorting responsibility and
            reassigning this task to the recycling facility.
        </p>
        <h3>Multiple Stream Recycling</h3>
        <p>
            Providing multiple bins to collect different recyclable
            materials. In this case, the public is burdened with the sorting
            and therefore have to know the difference between materials
            i.e., plastic vs paper vs glass. By ensuring that these
            materials are sorted at source, recycling facilities can head
            straight to business once the materials are handed over.

            <h2>Organic Waste</h2>
            <p>
                Organic waste is also common in almost all households. This
                waste consists of food waste, garden waste, and so on. While
                this waste is broken down by micro-organisms over time, it
                still needs to be appropriately disposed of when generated.
                Examples: food waste, chicken bone, fish spine, leaves
            </p>
            <p>
                Organic waste can easily degrade. This can be used to make
                compost or sent to local farmer or special organizations to
                make animal feed.
                <li>Composting</li>
                <li>Worm bins (Vermicomposting)</li>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="torecycle">
            <h2>Recyclable Waste</h2>
            <p>
                Recyclable rubbish refers to all waste that can be converted
                to reusable products. To understand this type of waste
                better, let's break it down into four common categories:
                <li>
                    Plastic Waste - consists of bags, containers, jars,
                    bottles made of plastic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Paper/Card Waste - includes newspapers, packaging
                    materials, cardboard, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tins and Metals - can be found in different forms
                    throughout your home or business ·
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ceramics and Glass - consist of broken ceramic cups and
                    plates, glass bottles, etc.
                </li>
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Paper</h3>
                <p>
                    Usually, paper waste is best separated from rest of
                    inorganic waste to avoid water or contamination from
                    other substances as paper is best recycled in dry
                    conditions and water can degrade paper’s quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    General rules:
                    <li>Product is dry and unsoiled</li>
                    <li>Remove sensitive info with black marker</li>
                    <li>Remove non-paper components</li>
                    <li>
                        Paper product with wax and/or plastic coatings as
                        well as flexible packaging cannot be recycled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Paper can consist of different types. Depending on
                        the recycling stream, you may be asked to put all
                        mixed paper in one container or to separate paper
                        waste more specifically. If you have sorted-stream
                        recycling, check local regulations before throwing
                        paper in the recycling bin.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common paper products:
                    <li>Cardboards and cartons: cut and flatten.</li>
                    <li>
                        Book, newspaper, and magazine: can be left as they
                        are, remove non-paper components, newspaper can be
                        used with organic waste for vermicomposting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Card and wrap: can be recycled if they contain no
                        additives (glitter, plastic, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Paper bag: fold and remove non-paper components</li>
                    <li>
                        Paper cup: split accessories (lid and sleeve),
                        recycle or compost if biodegradable, throw away if
                        cup has plastic lining.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shredded paper: store in a single container and
                        check with local recycling center for minimum size.
                    </li>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Glass and ceramic</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Do not break as broken glass and ceramic has less
                        recycling value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Separate non-container and container glass
                        (non-container or treated glass is more durable due
                        to chemicals and may have different melting point,
                        can contaminate recyclable glass during melting).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Non-container glass (e.g., window, mirrors): find a
                        construction and demolition (C&D) recycler to
                        process the material for contractors, schedule a
                        bulk waste pick-up with your local municipality’s
                        solid waste office for individuals and households.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Glass container: can leave label/foil, separate
                        based on color, separate caps/corks to ensure no
                        liquid left, remove any non-container parts from
                        container.
                    </li>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Plastic</h3>
                <p>
                    Separate based on resin identification code, plastic
                    with code 1 and 2 are mostly picked up by the recycling
                    programs. Plastic #7
                    is considered as difficult-to-recycle material. Ensure plastic products are clean and dry.
                    Common examples:
                <ol>1. PET,
                    ex: disposable water bottles</ol>
                <ol>2. HDPE, ex: plastic bottle
                    lid</ol>
                <ol>3. PVC, ex: PVC pipes, plastic straw</ol>
                <ol>4. LDPE, ex:
                    retail plastic bags</ol>
                <ol>5. PP, ex: ketchup bottles, cosmetic
                    container</ol>
                <ol>6. Styrofoam/Polystyrene, ex: disposable
                    plates and food packaging, egg cartons</ol>
                <ol>7. Other Plastic
                    Types, ex: water gallon, baby feeding bottle.</ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common plastic products:
                    <li>Plastic bag: Keep a bag collection bin in your house,
                        such as one big garbage bag for all bags. Since they
                        compact easily, you should be able to fit 50 to 100
                        plastic bags in one garbage bag. Make sure any bags you
                        are recycling have a #2 or #4 plastic symbol on them. If
                        not, you can't be sure what plastic resin the bag is
                        made from, so you'll want to reuse it instead, before
                        eventually throwing it away.</li>
                    <li>Packing peanuts: Reuse as
                        they do not biodegrade. There are much fewer of these
                        than shipping stores, so recycling should be seen as a
                        secondary option. You'll want to call and confirm if
                        there's a minimum quantity accepted for recycling. If
                        you must throw your packing peanuts in the garbage, keep
                        them contained in one bag so they don't escape from the
                        garbage truck during transportation and become litter</li>
                    <li>Plastic bottles and containers: Rinse and dry, separate
                        cap/lid from body (depending on local program), label
                        can be left on. When recycling plastic bottles, check to
                        see if they say "crush to conserve" on the label. If so,
                        remove the lid and crush the bottle by twisting from the
                        top and pressing it down. After it's crushed, place the
                        lid back on the bottle so it can also be recycled.</li>
                    <li>Plastic wrap and film: Most plastic films can be recycled together because they don't contain
                        chemical contaminants in their film. Cling wrap cannot be recycled because it is a complex
                        plastic made with chemicals that are difficult to remove during recycling.

                <h3>Metal</h3>
                <p>
                    Metal Most metal is recyclable (exception: radioactive
                    metals, objects containing mercury, lead-containing
                    products). General rules: rinse and dry if needed,
                    remove non-metal parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common metal products:
                    <li>Cans (aluminium and steel):
                        label can be left on, rinse and dry, remove lid and
                        insert to can, pinch top to close cans. For those of you
                        can recyclers who are part of a multiple-stream
                        recycling program (sorting your cans in separate bins),
                        feel free to crush away. But if all your recycling is
                        tossed into one bin, keep your cans intact. It may take
                        up more space, but it’s easier and better for recycling
                        centers to distinguish what’s what when sorting if you
                        don’t crush your aluminum cans.</li>
                    <li>Aerosol can: ensure
                        empty, remove plastic cap, do not puncture hole, recheck
                        if considered hazard</li>
                    <li>Scrap metal: remove non-metal
                        parts. General rule to determine if it’s worth
                        recycling: product needs to be at least 50% metal or
                        contain small amounts of metal that can be easily
                        removed.</li>
                    <li>Aluminium foil: foil combined with other
                        inseparable materials are considered recycling
                        contamination and should be thrown away, ensure foil is
                        as clean as possible, combine all sheets of foil into
                        one ball (this will keep the material easily separated
                        from other products, and also prevent it from blowing
                        away).</li>

            <h2>Non-recyclable Waste</h2>
            <p>
                The residual waste is the type of trash that cannot be
                recycled further and most likely will end at the landfill.
                Technically, some of these materials are recyclables, but
                for practical purposes, only those that couldn’t be recycled
                as easily as any other materials are categorized as residue
                or residual waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several items that are
                considered as difficult-to-recycle items: 1. Cotton pad 2.
                Wet tissue 3. Paper towel 4. Cotton bud 5. Toilet paper 6.
                Napkin 7. Diaper 8. Coconut shell 9. Durian shell 10.
                Textile 11. Plastic sachet 12. Laminated packaging/refill
                pouches 14. Wet paper/carton 15. Styrofoam Residual waste It
                should be disposed of ecologically through a long-term
                disposal facility or sanitary landfill. 4) Hazardous waste
                Hazard waste refers to any waste that’s toxic, flammable,
                corrosive, or reactive. Such waste can be harmful to both
                you and the environment Examples: lightbulb, electronic
                waste, printer ink, used battery, hairspray, pesticides,
                detergent, floor cleaner solution
            </p>

            <h2>Hazardous Waste</h2>
            <p>
                Hazard waste refers to any waste that’s toxic, flammable,
                corrosive, or reactive. Such waste can be harmful to both
                you and the environment Examples: lightbulb, electronic

            </p>
            <p>
                Hazardous waste should be separated and bagged individually.
                Prepare a separate bin for batteries and another bin for
                lightbulb, kept away from the fire source and distribute it
                to your nearest professional recycling agents, trusted
                recycling center, or to the seller (if they’re willing to
                accept their own used products). Items that are considered
                as hazardous and toxic waste are batteries, lightbulb, spray
                can, and pesticide.
