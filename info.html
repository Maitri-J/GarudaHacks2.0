            <h1>How should I recycle?</h1>
            <p>
                Different waste requires different recycling approach. This
                means that to recycle your waste, you need to sort them into
                different categories. However, you should also check your local
                recycling center and find out what they require regarding waste
                sorting. Here are two common methods of recycling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Single Stream Recycling <br />
                This means collecting all recyclables with a single bin. The
                concept here is to make recycling easier for the general
                population by taking away the sorting responsibility and
                reassigning this task to the recycling facility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiple Stream Recycling <br />
                Providing multiple bins to collect different recyclable
                materials. In this case, the public is burdened with the sorting
                and therefore have to know the difference between materials
                i.e., plastic vs paper vs glass. By ensuring that these
                materials are sorted at source, recycling facilities can head
                straight to business once the materials are handed over.

                <p>
                    Organic waste is also common in almost all households. This
                    waste consists of food waste, garden waste, and so on. While
                    this waste is broken down by micro-organisms over time, it
                    still needs to be appropriately disposed of when generated.
                    Examples: food waste, chicken bone, fish spine, leaves
                </p>
                <p>
                    Organic waste can easily degrade. This can be used to make
                    compost or sent to local farmer or special organizations to
                    make animal feed.

                <h2>Recyclable Waste</h2>
                <p>
                    Recyclable rubbish refers to all waste that can be converted
                    to reusable products. To understand this type of waste
                    better, let's break it down into four common categories: ·
                    Plastic Waste -consists of bags, containers, jars, bottles
                    made of plastic. · Paper/Card Waste - includes newspapers,
                    packaging materials, cardboard, etc. · Tins and Metals - can
                    be found in different forms throughout your home or business
                    · Ceramics and Glass - consist of broken ceramic cups and
                    plates, glass bottles, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paper
                    https://earth911.com/business-policy/paper-recycling-details-basics/
                    Usually, paper waste is best separated from rest of
                    inorganic waste to avoid water or contamination from other
                    substances as paper is best recycled in dry conditions and
                    water can degrade paper’s quality. General rules: paper
                    product is dry and unsoiled, remove sensitive info with
                    black marker, remove non-paper components, paper product
                    with wax and/or plastic coatings as well as flexible
                    packaging cannot be recycled. Paper can consist of different
                    types. Depending on the recycling stream, you may be asked
                    to put all mixed paper in one container or to separate paper
                    waste more specifically. If you have sorted-stream
                    recycling, check local regulations before throwing paper in
                    the recycling bin. - Cardboards and cartons: cut and
                    flatten. - Book, newspaper, and magazine: can be left as
                    they are, remove non-paper components, newspaper can be used
                    with organic waste for vermicomposting. - Card and wrap: can
                    be recycled if they contain no additives (glitter, plastic,
                    etc.) - Paper bag: remove non-paper components. - Paper cup:
                    split accessories (lid and sleeve), recycle or compost if
                    biodegradable, throw away if cup has plastic lining. -
                    Shredded paper: store in a single container and check with
                    local recycling center for minimum size. Glass and ceramic -
                    Do not break as broken glass and ceramic has less recycling
                    value. - Separate non-container and container glass
                    (non-container or treated glass is more durable due to
                    chemicals and may have different melting point, can
                    contaminate recyclable glass during melting) - Non-container
                    glass (e.g., window, mirrors): find a construction and
                    demolition (C&D) recycler to process the material for
                    contractors, schedule a bulk waste pick-up with your local
                    municipality’s solid waste office for individuals and
                    households - Glass container: can leave label/foil, separate
                    based on color, separate caps/corks to ensure no liquid
                    left, remove any non-container parts from container Plastic
                    https://waste4change.com/blog/7-types-plastic-need-know/ can
                    maybe make choice plastic -> input number (1-7 + others
                    where 7 & others go to the same text?) Separate based on
                    resin identification code, 1 and 2 are mostly picked up by
                    the recycling programs. Ensure clean and dry. Common
                    examples: 1. PET, ex: disposable water bottles 2. HDPE, ex:
                    plastic bottle lid 3. PVC, ex: PVC pipes, plastic straw 4.
                    LDPE, ex: retail plastic bags 5. PP, ex: ketchup bottles,
                    cosmetic container 6. Styrofoam/Polystyrene, ex: disposable
                    plates and food packaging, egg cartons 7. Other Plastic
                    Types, ex: water gallon, baby feeding bottle. Plastic #7 is
                    considered as difficult-to-recycle material. - Plastic bag:
                    Keep a bag collection bin in your house, such as one big
                    garbage bag for all bags. Since they compact easily, you
                    should be able to fit 50 to 100 plastic bags in one garbage
                    bag. Make sure any bags you are recycling have a #2 or #4
                    plastic symbol on them. If not, you can't be sure what
                    plastic resin the bag is made from, so you'll want to reuse
                    it instead, before eventually throwing it away. - Packing
                    peanuts: Reuse as they do not biodegrade. There are much
                    fewer of these than shipping stores, so recycling should be
                    seen as a secondary option. You'll want to call and confirm
                    if there's a minimum quantity accepted for recycling. If you
                    must throw your packing peanuts in the garbage, keep them
                    contained in one bag so they don't escape from the garbage
                    truck during transportation and become litter - Plastic
                    bottles and containers: Rinse and dry, separate cap/lid from
                    body (depending on local program), label can be left on.
                    When recycling plastic bottles, check to see if they say
                    "crush to conserve" on the label. If so, remove the lid and
                    crush the bottle by twisting from the top and pressing it
                    down. After it's crushed, place the lid back on the bottle
                    so it can also be recycled. - Plastic wrap and film: Please
                    DO recycle: - Grocery and retail bags - Newspaper bags - The
                    outer wrapping from napkins, paper towels, bathroom tissue,
                    and diapers - Bread bags - Dry cleaning bags - The outer
                    wrapping from bulk beverages - Produce bags - All clean, dry
                    bags labeled #2 or #4 Please DO NOT recycle: - Food or cling
                    wrap - Prepackaged food bags (including frozen food bags and
                    pre-washed salad bags) - Plastic film that has been painted
                    or has excessive glue residue Metal Most metal is recyclable
                    (exception: radioactive metals, objects containing mercury,
                    lead-containing products). General rules: rinse and dry if
                    needed, remove non-metal parts. - Cans (aluminium and
                    steel): label can be left on, rinse and dry, remove lid and
                    insert to can, pinch top to close cans. For those of you can
                    recyclers who are part of a multiple-stream recycling
                    program (sorting your cans in separate bins), feel free to
                    crush away. But if all your recycling is tossed into one
                    bin, keep your cans intact. It may take up more space, but
                    it’s easier and better for recycling centers to distinguish
                    what’s what when sorting if you don’t crush your aluminum
                    cans. - Aerosol can: ensure empty, remove plastic cap, do
                    not puncture hole, recheck if considered hazard - Scrap
                    metal: remove non-metal parts. General rule to determine if
                    it’s worth recycling: product needs to be at least 50% metal
                    or contain small amounts of metal that can be easily
                    removed. - Aluminium foil: foil combined with other
                    inseparable materials are considered recycling contamination
                    and should be thrown away, ensure foil is as clean as
                    possible, combine all sheets of foil into one ball (this
                    will keep the material easily separated from other products,
                    and also prevent it from blowing away).

                <h2>Non-recyclable Waste</h2>
                <p>
                    The residual waste is the type of trash that cannot be
                    recycled further and most likely will end at the landfill.
                    Technically, some of these materials are recyclables, but
                    for practical purposes, only those that couldn’t be recycled
                    as easily as any other materials are categorized as residue
                    or residual waste. Main reasons some material is considered
                    residual waste are: · May cause machine damage, for example,
                    plastic wrap or cling wrap which is very flexible and thin
                    so it is very prone to be entangled inside the recycling
                    machine · Could be a source of disease and contaminate other
                    materials during recycling, for example, used diapers, used
                    sanitary napkins, and used tissue that may bring saliva,
                    dirt, and blood. Even after washing, the contaminants may
                    still be left behind, so it is still a risk for waste
                    management and the environment. · Difficult to be processed
                    for recycling, for example, pads, laminated plastic, and
                    sachet (multi-layered plastic) consisting of several types
                    of material. To be able to recycle these objects, the
                    material needs to be separated according to one type and the
                    other. If there is no special technology, the separation is
                    still done manually and requires a lot of time and human
                    resources. · The quality of recycled products is very low,
                    for example used tissue or brown paper. Brown paper is
                    usually the lowest recycled paper material. Recycling the
                    paper material again will produce brown paper with a much
                    lower quality — so low that the selling value also
                    decreases, almost none. This is why some recycling partners
                    and waste banks do not accept recycled brown paper, so it is
                    better if the brown paper is processed into compost. · The
                    costs required for the recycling process are quite
                    expensive, for example, textile materials. Textile recycling
                    required complicated technology, the cost is also not cheap,
                    and consumed quite a lot of energy. For this reason, many
                    recycling partners still categorize textiles as materials
                    that are difficult to recycle. Several items that are
                    considered as difficult-to-recycle items: 1. Cotton pad 2.
                    Wet tissue 3. Paper towel 4. Cotton bud 5. Toilet paper 6.
                    Napkin 7. Diaper 8. Coconut shell 9. Durian shell 10.
                    Textile 11. Plastic sachet 12. Laminated packaging/refill
                    pouches 14. Wet paper/carton 15. Styrofoam Residual waste It
                    should be disposed of ecologically through a long-term
                    disposal facility or sanitary landfill. 4) Hazardous waste
                    Hazard waste refers to any waste that’s toxic, flammable,
                    corrosive, or reactive. Such waste can be harmful to both
                    you and the environment Examples: lightbulb, electronic
                    waste, printer ink, used battery, hairspray, pesticides,
                    detergent, floor cleaner solution

                    Hazardous waste should be separated and bagged individually.
                    Prepare a separate bin for batteries and another bin for
                    lightbulb, kept away from the fire source and distribute it
                    to your nearest professional recycling agents, trusted
                    recycling center, or to the seller (if they’re willing to
                    accept their own used products). Items that are considered
                    as hazardous and toxic waste are batteries, lightbulb, spray
                    can, and pesticide.
